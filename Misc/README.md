    ```
4. **Check the Output**: The script will generate a CSV file at the specified location with the folder sizes and paths.

## Notes for macOS Users

- If you get "App registration failed...keychain" errors, manually register your Azure AD app in the Azure Portal and enter the Client ID when prompted.

    ```
- Make sure your app has `Sites.Read.All` permission with admin consent.
